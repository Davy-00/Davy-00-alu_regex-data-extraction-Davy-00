# Regular Expressions Project

This project contains a series of Ruby scripts that demonstrate the use of regular expressions using the Oniguruma library (Ruby's default regex engine). Each script accepts one argument and uses a regular expression to match or extract specific patterns from the input.

## Project Structure

- `regular_expressions/0-simply_match_school.rb`: Matches the word "School".
- `regular_expressions/1-repetition_token_0.rb`: Matches zero or more occurrences of "School".
- `regular_expressions/2-repetition_token_1.rb`: Matches one or more occurrences of "School".
- `regular_expressions/3-repetition_token_2.rb`: Matches zero or one occurrence of "School".
- `regular_expressions/4-repetition_token_3.rb`: Matches zero or more occurrences of "School" without using square brackets.
- `regular_expressions/5-beginning_and_end.rb`: Matches strings starting with 'h', ending with 'n', and having any single character in between.
- `regular_expressions/6-phone_number.rb`: Matches a 10-digit phone number exactly.
- `regular_expressions/7-OMG_WHY_ARE_YOU_SHOUTING.rb`: Matches only capital letters.
- `regular_expressions/8-textme.rb`: Extracts sender, receiver, and flags from a log string.

## Usage

Each script is executable and can be run from the command line with one argument. For example:

```bash
./regular_expressions/0-simply_match_school.rb "Best School"
```

## Requirements

- All scripts use the Oniguruma regular expression library.
- All scripts have the shebang line `#!/usr/bin/env ruby`.
- All scripts end with a newline.
- The project is designed to run on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

## Notes

- Task 9 requires solving a LinkedIn regex puzzle and providing a screenshot, which is not included here.
